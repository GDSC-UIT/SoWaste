## Backend Installation

You can find the backend installation guide [here](https://github.com/GDSC-UIT/sowaste-backend/blob/main/README.md)

## AI Model Installation

You can find the AI model installation guide [here](https://github.com/tien02/waste_detect_api/blob/main/README.md#run-on-local)

For our AI service, we use [Yolov5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) and [Yolov8](https://ultralytics.com/yolov8). [TACO dataset](http://tacodataset.org/) was used to train the model. Although the model's accuracy doesn't seem to be perfect, we're still working on studies to enhance it.

Next, we use the Google Cloud Platform service to host our end-point created by [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).

Here are some examples of waste our AI system has detected:
